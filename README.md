## Personas

* _User personas: Scott "I need a workspace for his team." - Scott has recently started a new start up that helps customer find shoes that are hard to purchase. He needs a small place where him and his team can work together is a nice and clean workspace._

* _User personas: Cole "I need a workspace to code" - Cole has recently moved here and need a place to work. He currently working remote and will like a place that has fast internet and coffee_

* _User personas: Devin "I need a place to be creative" - Devin wants to open a new online store where customer's can buy pet toy's. He needs a place that is quiet and also a place where he can meet more creative minds._


## User Stories

* _Target users: potential members of the co-working space (freelancers, entrepreneurs and their employees, remote workers, creatives), co-working management_

* _We just finished remodeling our space, so We want to attract people that would really enjoy working in our environment._

* _We want our space--no, our whole company--to feel a little luxurious, cool, and high-end; yet still 100% welcoming and inclusive to everyone. A safe, comfortable, and productive work environment._

* _We have an on-site coffee counter, both communal working areas and private offices, high-speed internet, printing and faxing services._

* _We usually have a fun, optional activity on Thursday afternoons. Like yoga, maybe a fun complementary food, or like...I don't know, maybe even crafts sometimes (come make your own mini desktop terrarium)._

### Technologies and Resources

* _I looked up two different companies that also opened a co-working space and got ideas from their website_

* _Tech Space uses clean font and is easy to navigate through the site._

* _we work uses clean more bold font, is easy to navigate through the site and uses logos to show who they have worked with._

* _I used the software sketch to wireframe and also prototype the project_


### Responsiveness

* _When you are on the desktop view you can see the side Navigation bar the whole time. But once into tablet or mobile view the navigation will be at the top right corner. In mobile view the image will take up the whole width of the page_
