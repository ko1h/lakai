## Target Users

* _Target users: potential members of the co-working space (freelancers, entrepreneurs and their employees, remote workers, creatives), co-working management_

* _We just finished remodeling our space, so We want to attract people that would really enjoy working in our environment._

* _We want our space--no, our whole company--to feel a little luxurious, cool, and high-end; yet still 100% welcoming and inclusive to everyone. A safe, comfortable, and productive work environment._

* _We have an on-site coffee counter, both communal working areas and private offices, high-speed internet, printing and faxing services._

* _We usually have a fun, optional activity on Thursday afternoons. Like yoga, maybe a fun complementary food, or like...I don't know, maybe even crafts sometimes (come make your own mini desktop terrarium)._
